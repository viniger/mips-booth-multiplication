This project aims to make an implementation of Booth's Multiplication Algorithm for MIPS architecture.

Booth's Multiplication Algorithm is an approach to reduce the number of arithmetic operations necessary to perform a multiplication. It assumes that a shift takes less time than an add or subtract instruction and uses this fact in reducing the number of arithmetic instructions.

Simply saying, it works by identifying the 1s and 0s before performing shifts.
